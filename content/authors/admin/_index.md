I am currently a PhD of Finance candidate within the University at Buffalo Finance and Managerial Economics department. For my Bachelor's Degree I double majored in Finance and Actuarial Mathematics, as well as triple minored in Statistics, Computer Science, and Economics. I went on to double major in the Masters of Finance program, pursuing both Financial Management and Quantitative Finance. Currently my research interests revolve around Sustainability, ESG, and Green Finance - in addition to Textual Analysis and Cross Sectional Factor Pricing. I aim for my research to make a real difference for future policy decisions.\
\
I have been the Instructor for Financial Modeling (MBA/MS level) starting since Fall 2018, reinventing the class every year to showcase what R (RStudio/Posit) is capable of. We focus on incorporating Time Series Modeling, CRSP/Compustat analysis through Wharton, SQL, API linkages, Machine Learning, Fundamental and Technical Analysis, Valuation, and so much more. Since then, I've also moved on to teach Investments, Advanced Corporate Finance, Microeconomics, Portfolio Theory, and more here at UB as well as Buffalo State College and Erie Community College.
